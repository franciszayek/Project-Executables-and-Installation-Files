BluetoothTouchPad and Geocache Android Apps apk files and BluetoothListener jar file

Geocache Android App
  Everything seems to be working except the tests are failing for reasons unknown. Application should still run fine. 

BluetoothTouchPad Android App
  The latest apk here is not in sync with the code in the BluetoothTouchPad repository. My Android environment has changed since 
  I completed this app, and I found it difficult to get a successful build since moving to Android Sudio. I also couldn't find the 
  latest apk on my local machine.
  
  Known issues with this version that are fixed with the latest code:
    1. Desktop gesture does not work
    2. Zoom in/out have reversed functionality
    3. General connectivity issues
    
  How to connect the app to your PC:
    1. The two devices may need to be paired.
    2. Run the BluetoothListener JAR file
    3. Click "Discover Devices"
    4. Open the app and press "Find Remote Device"
    5. Choose your PC's name
    6. Press "Connect"
